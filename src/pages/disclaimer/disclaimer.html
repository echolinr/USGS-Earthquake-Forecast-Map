<h1>General Disclaimer</h1>
<p> Some USGS information accessed through this page may be preliminary in nature and presented prior to final review and approval by the Director of the USGS. This information is provided with the understanding that it is not guaranteed to be correct or complete, and conclusions drawn from such information are the sole responsibility of the user.</p>
<p>These maps are preliminary in nature and they will be updated frequently as data is supplemented by additional observations. It is important to reload your browser to see the update.</p>
<h1>Specific Disclaimer</h1>
<p>Locations within the same intensity area will not necessarily experience the same level of damage since damage depends heavily on the type of structure, the nature of the construction, and the details of the ground motion at that site, whereas a CIIM intensity value is intended to represent an average value for an entire ZIP code region. For this reason more or less damage than described in the intensity scale may occur.</p>
<h1>Privacy Act Statement</h1>
<p>You are not required to provide your personal contact information in order to submit your survey. However, if you do not provide contact information, we may be unable to contact you for additional information to verify your responses. If you do provide contact information, this information will only be used to initiate follow-up communications with you. The records for this collection will be maintained in the appropriate Privacy Act System of Records identified as Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquake Information. (INTERIOR/USGS-2) published at 74 FR 34033 (July 14,2009).</p>
<h1>Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</h1>
<p>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.) requires us to inform you that this information is being collected to supplement instrumental data and to promote public safety through better understanding of earthquakes. Response to this request is voluntary. Public reporting for this form is estimated to average 6 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions and completing the form. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. Comments regarding this collection of information should be directed to: Bureau Clearance officer, U.S. Geological Survey, 807 National Center, Reston, VA 20192.</p>
